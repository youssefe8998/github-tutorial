## Repository Setup
**Step 1** To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo.

**Step 2** Use git add command to add relevant files and changes.

**Step 3** Use git commit command to commit or confirm changes being made in the file

## Workflow & Commands

**git status** Not sure if you're working on a clean branch? Want to see what files have changed? Git status will show you a report.

**git add** Now that you've added or modified some files, you need to stage those commits into the "staging area". This could be done with git add.

**git commit** Now that you've made your changes and staged them, you want to commit or confirm these changes on your own file which is done with git commit.

**git push** This command will confirm and officially send your modifications to github.


---
## Rolling Back Changes

**git revert** Git revert command helps you undo any recent or existing commits.
